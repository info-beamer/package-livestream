    Additional Copyrights
    =====================

    Some files are copyright by the following additional copyright
    holders, though in all cases, the copyright is held jointly with IBM
    and is subject ICU license above:

     * Google Inc.
     * Yahoo! Inc.

    Some files in source/data/sprep contain data that was programmatically
    extracted from RFC 3454, but this programmatic extraction was done as
    a one-time activity and is not part of ICU's build process.  The
    non-free RFC 3454 document is not part of the sources.  The files
    generated from RFC 3454 could be considered derived works, so the RFC
    3454 copyright requires the inclusion of the original RFC 3454
    copyright notice:

       This document and translations of it may be copied and furnished to
       others, and derivative works that comment on or otherwise explain it
       or assist in its implementation may be prepared, copied, published
       and distributed, in whole or in part, without restriction of any
       kind, provided that the above copyright notice and this paragraph are
       included on all such copies and derivative works.  However, this
       document itself may not be modified in any way, such as by removing
       the copyright notice or references to the Internet Society or other
       Internet organizations, except as needed for the purpose of
       developing Internet standards in which case the procedures for
       copyrights defined in the Internet Standards process must be
       followed, or as required to translate it into languages other than
       English.

       The limited permissions granted above are perpetual and will not be
       revoked by the Internet Society or its successors or assigns.
