# Description

Uses the [streamlink](https://streamlink.github.io/) streaming command line utility to stream from various stream providers
like Twitch, Youtube or others. You can find the full list of supported sources [here](https://streamlink.github.io/plugin_matrix.html).

This package is still experimental, so streaming might not work. You also get little feedback about the state of the
stream. If you run into problems, please use the [issue tracker](https://github.com/info-beamer/package-livestream/issues).
